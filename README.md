# 1)Problem Statement
The project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify the key variables influencing lung cancer prevalence in individuals. By analyzing various demographic, environmental, and behavioral factors, the model seeks to discern patterns and predictors that are significantly associated with the incidence of lung cancer. 

# 2)Data cleaning
- Remove NULL values 
- Remove duplicates 
- Replace numerical value with the corresponding category label

# 3)Exploratory Data Analysis

# 4)Machine learning models
- Support vector machine
- Logistic Regression \
We used SVM and logistic regression on our dataset as the data consist of categoerical variables only
